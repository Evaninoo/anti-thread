## Features

### Main functionality
When a thread is created, the bot automatically delete it, and log it into the console.

### Log into the console
As soon as the thread is created, you are aware of it by seeing it in the console. You see the <strong>name</strong> of the thread, and the <strong>author</strong> of it. <br/>

### Owner / Exempt functionality
Thanks to the owner functionality, you can allow certain users to create threads. To do this, go to the <strong>config.js</strong>, and replace 'id 1', by the first id of the owner. Same, for the second, third, etc.<br/>

## How to Install
Create the application and then the bot on [Discord Developper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Take the bot token and put it in the <strong>config.js</strong>, in the place of 'your secret token'.
Then if you want to add owners, replace ids by the ids of owners.

Make sure you have version 16 of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

Then install node modules by opening a terminal and typing `npm i`. 

Now you can start the bot by typing `node index.js` in your terminal.
